This is the course page
for the summer semester 2018 edition of the course
statistical natural language processing (NLP)
at the [Department of Linguistics](http://sfs.uni-tuebingen.de),
[University of Tübingen](http://uni-tuebingen.de).

Natural language processing  is
an important part of areas or disciplines
that are concerned with language and computation
including (computational) linguistics, artificial intelligence and
computer science. NLP is crucial both for building practical
applications and answering research questions in many areas of
research.

This course is an undergraduate introduction to natural language
processing. The aim of this course is to expose students to a large
variety of topics in NLP. Broadly the topics of the course include:

- Machine learning techniques used in NLP,
  such as classification,
  sequence learning and unsupervised methods,
  with both 'classical' methods (e.g., logistic regression,
  naive Bayes) and (deep) neural networks.
- Statistical approaches to text processing, segmentation/tokenization,
  morphology, syntax and semantics.
- Common application areas of NLP,
  such as text classification, question answering, machine
  translation.

This is a practical, fast-paced, broad introduction to the field.
Fluency in programming and ability to learn new programming languages
and/or environments will be assumed.

The course is compulsory for the BA degree International Studies in
Computational Linguistics. For other degree programs, please contact
the instructor before signing up.

This year, we will use
[GitHub classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/36228864-nlp-course-sfs-university-of-tubingen)
for assignments.
You need to obtain a [GitHub](https://github.com) account
to receive and submit your assignments.
